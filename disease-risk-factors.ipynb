Accurate risk factor prediction helps developing strategies aimed at avoiding unnecessary interventions for patients and reducing costs for insurance companies and healthcare providers. \n",

    "An important step towards risk factor prediction is the identification of individuals who would benefit from preventive treatment. Machine-learning algorithms are strongly suited for this task as they can improve identification accuracy by exploiting complex interactions between different risk factors and patient data features associated to disease [2]. \n",

    "In particular, supervised and unsupervised learning techniques can be applied to extract risk-associated features from readily available healthcare data, including demographic and wellness data, lifestyle behavior and health status markers.\n",

    "analytics are **diabetes** and **cardiovascular disease (CVD).** In the United States, estimates indicate the existence of 30.3 million people with diabetes (9.4% of the US population) including 23.1 million people who are diagnosed and 7.2 million people (23.8%) undiagnosed. The numbers for prediabetes indicate that 84.1 million adults (33.9% of the adult U.S. population) have prediabetes, including 23.1 million adults aged 65 years or older (the age group with highest rate). \n",
