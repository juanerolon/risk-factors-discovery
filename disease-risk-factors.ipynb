Machine-learning algorithms are strongly suited for this task as they can improve identification accuracy by exploiting complex interactions between different risk factors and patient data features associated to disease [2]. \n",

The numbers for prediabetes indicate that 84.1 million adults (33.9% of the adult U.S. population) have prediabetes, including 23.1 million adults aged 65 years or older (the age group with highest rate). \n",

A node is split only when the resulting split gives a positive reduction in the loss function. Gamma specifies the minimum loss reduction required to make a split. Makes the algorithm conservative. The values can vary depending on the loss function and should be tuned.\n",

    "Although, by using a much smaller dataset in comparison to scaled-up models, we have obtained results which are in strong qualitative and semi-quantitative agreement with the benchmarks. \n",

    "Our results are also consistent with the clinical literature. This further strengthens the notion that machine learning models can be applied to aid in medical diagnosis by mining healthcare data to discover disease risk predictors.\n",

    "The results of this project can be potentially improved by the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tAssembling a larger dataset by integrating the remaining NHANES surveys available at the US CDC. This will greatly reflect in all performance measures, in particular decreasing the number of false negatives in our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tScaling-up the feature space by integrating other relevant features present in related datasets.\n",

    "-\tProbing alternative oversampling strategies and different classifier models capable increasing the signal to noise ratio, e.g. deep neural-network based classifiers.\n",

    "-\tImplementing longer and heterogeneous training pipelines combining the power of several different classifiers. \n"
