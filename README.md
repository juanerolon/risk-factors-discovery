# Machine Learning Approach to the Discovery of Disease Risk Factors on Individuals Assessed by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2013-2014

### Juan E. Rolon

Original capstone project submitted to Udacity, Inc. as partial fulfillment to obtain the certification as a Machine Learning Engineer. 

## Project Overview

The prediction of chronic disease risk factors is one of the most important and challenging problems in healthcare analytics. Accurate risk factor prediction helps developing strategies aimed at avoiding unnecessary interventions for patients and reducing costs for insurance companies and healthcare providers.

In this project, we train a **gradient boosting classifier** on publicly available data, to identify risk predictors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease for individuals residing in the United States. Our results suggest that researchers and clinicians could make use of machine learning analyses to obtain valuable health assessment of patients at a much reduced cost and time.
